# WhisperKit Features

This document provides detailed information on the key features of WhisperKit and how they can be utilized in your applications.

## Core Features

### On-Device Speech-to-Text

WhisperKit provides high-quality speech-to-text transcription that runs entirely on-device, ensuring privacy and offline functionality. The transcription is powered by Apple's CoreML framework, optimized for performance on Apple devices.

### Real-Time Streaming

WhisperKit supports real-time streaming transcription, allowing applications to process audio as it's being captured. This feature is essential for applications that require immediate feedback, such as voice assistants, live captioning, and interactive voice experiences.

### Word Timestamps

WhisperKit can generate timestamps for each word in the transcription, enabling precise alignment between audio and text. This feature is valuable for applications such as:

- Subtitle generation
- Audio/video editing tools
- Educational applications
- Accessibility features

### Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

The built-in Voice Activity Detection system can identify when someone is speaking versus background noise. This helps to:

- Reduce processing of non-speech audio
- Improve transcription accuracy
- Conserve battery life by only processing relevant audio
- Enhance user experience by only transcribing when speech is detected

### Multi-Language Support

WhisperKit supports transcription in multiple languages, making it suitable for international applications. The framework can automatically detect the language being spoken or be configured to transcribe in a specific language.

## Advanced Features

### Customizable Models

WhisperKit allows for the selection of different model sizes to balance accuracy and performance:

- **Tiny**: Fastest, lowest memory footprint, suitable for resource-constrained environments
- **Small**: Good balance of speed and accuracy for most applications
- **Medium**: Higher accuracy with moderate resource requirements
- **Large**: Highest accuracy, suitable for applications where precision is critical

### Fine-Tuned Models

WhisperKit supports loading custom fine-tuned models, allowing developers to optimize for specific domains, accents, or specialized vocabulary. This is particularly useful for:

- Medical transcription
- Legal documentation
- Technical fields with specialized terminology
- Regional accent optimization

### Automatic Punctuation and Formatting

WhisperKit can automatically add punctuation and format the transcribed text, making the output more readable and natural. This includes:

- Sentence capitalization
- Comma and period placement
- Question and exclamation marks
- Paragraph breaks

### Confidence Scores

For each transcribed segment, WhisperKit provides confidence scores that indicate the reliability of the transcription. This allows applications to:

- Highlight potentially misrecognized words
- Request user confirmation for low-confidence segments
- Filter out unreliable transcriptions
- Improve user experience by indicating uncertainty

## Performance Optimizations

### Adaptive Sampling

WhisperKit can adapt its processing based on the available system resources, ensuring optimal performance across different devices. This includes:

- Dynamic model selection based on device capabilities
- Adjustable processing batch sizes
- Memory usage optimization

### Background Processing

WhisperKit supports background processing, allowing transcription to continue even when the application is not in the foreground. This is particularly useful for:

- Long-form audio transcription
- Voice note applications
- Recording and transcribing meetings

### Energy Efficiency

The framework is optimized for energy efficiency, making it suitable for mobile applications where battery life is a concern. This includes:

- Efficient use of the Neural Engine
- Minimized CPU usage
- Optimized memory access patterns

## Integration Features

### Swift API

WhisperKit provides a clean, easy-to-use Swift API that integrates seamlessly with iOS and macOS applications. The API follows Swift conventions and best practices, making it intuitive for Swift developers.

### Command Line Interface

WhisperKit includes a command-line interface for testing and debugging outside of an Xcode project. This is useful for:

- Quick testing of transcription capabilities
- Batch processing of audio files
- Integration with other command-line tools
- Automated testing and CI/CD pipelines

### Flutter Integration

Through the Flutter WhisperKit Apple plugin, WhisperKit can be used in Flutter applications, providing cross-platform capabilities while leveraging the native performance of WhisperKit on Apple devices.

## Use Cases

### Accessibility Applications

WhisperKit is ideal for creating accessibility applications that convert speech to text for users with hearing impairments. The real-time capabilities and high accuracy make it suitable for live captioning and transcription.

### Content Creation Tools

Applications for content creators can use WhisperKit to automatically transcribe interviews, podcasts, or video content, saving time and effort in the content production process.

### Language Learning

Language learning applications can use WhisperKit to provide real-time feedback on pronunciation and speaking exercises, helping users improve their language skills.

### Meeting Transcription

WhisperKit can be used to transcribe meetings and conversations, creating searchable records and improving collaboration by making discussions accessible to all team members.

### Voice Assistants

The real-time capabilities and on-device processing make WhisperKit suitable for creating privacy-focused voice assistants that don't rely on cloud services for speech recognition.
